**CRITICAL ANTI-ERROR RULE:** Before writing ANY line of code that calls, modifies, or interacts with another existing module, class, or function (especially those in `src/` or defined in `architecture.md`):

1.  **MANDATORY PREVENTIVE READING:** ALWAYS use the `read_file` tool to read the ENTIRE content of the target module/class source file. Identify the EXACT names of methods, functions, attributes, parameters, and constants you intend to use. DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS based on common naming conventions.
2.  **SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION:** Pay utmost attention to method/function signatures (parameter names, types, return values). Ensure your calling code EXACTLY matches the definition.
3.  **SEARCH IF NECESSARY:** If reading the file does not clarify correct usage or if there are doubts, use `codebase_search` or `grep_search` to find existing usage examples of that method/class within the codebase.
4.  **NO NAME GUESSING:** Do not invent or guess method or attribute names (e.g., `get_api_key` instead of `get_key`, `get_trace_or_span` or `shutdown` if not explicitly defined and verified). Direct verification via `read_file` is MANDATORY.

## Other Key Rules

*   **Read `.cursor/knowledge-base/architecture.md`:** ALWAYS before writing any code. This file explains the structure of the SK that is the base of the project. Include `.cursor/knowledge-base/directory_structure.md` if necessary.
*   **Modularity:** ALWAYS prefer modularity (multiple files) and discourage monoliths (one giant file).
*   **Clean Code:** Prefer Clean Code architecture and code readability.
*   **User Communication:**
    *   DO NOT modify code without asking for explicit user confirmation, unless it's a correction of an error introduced by you in the same interaction and you are CERTAIN of the correction.
    *   Maintain the role of a critical advisor as defined in the initial instructions.

**The primary goal is to produce working and well-integrated code ON THE FIRST TRY, minimizing debugging cycles due to misinterpretation of existing interfaces.**
